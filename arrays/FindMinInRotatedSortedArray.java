 * Leetcode 153: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
 * - -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
 * - All elements are unique
 * - The array is sorted in ascending order and rotated between 1 and n times
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(log n) - due to binary search
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - constant extra space

/**
 * Some potential follow-ups:
 * 
 * 1. What is the array contains duplicates?
 * => In such cases, BS can't always decide which half is sorted based on 
 * nums[mid] and nums[right]
 * 
 * Solution
 * if (nums[mid] == nums[right]) {
    right--; // safely shrink the search space
}
 * Time complexity will degrade to O(n) in worst-case
 * 
 * 2. Can we solve it recursively?
 * Yes, but doing that will increase call stack space.
 * 
 * 3. What if the array was rotated but not sorted originally?
 * => Binary search relies on a sorted array. 
 * If the original array isn't sorted before rotation, this approach fails. 
 * We'd need a linear scan
 * 
 * 4. What if the array is rotated zero times?
=> easiest. Because the array is still sorted â€” and the first element is the minimum.

5. Index of the minimum element, not just the value?
=> return left, instead of nums[left] at the end.@interface
 * 
 * 
 * 6. Find how many times the array was rotated?
 * => Yes. It's simply the index of the minimum element.
 * int rotationCount = indexOfMin; // Same as left at the end of binary search
